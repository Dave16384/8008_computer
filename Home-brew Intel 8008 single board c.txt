Home-brew Intel 8008 single board computer with SCELBAL BASIC interpreter in EPROM. The hardware design borrows heavily from Len Bayles's Intel 8008 Computer Clock and Jim Kearney's Tiny 8. The SCELBAL BASIC Interpreter can be found at Mike Willegal's SCELBAL BASIC page. The firmware was assembled using the Macro Assembler AS.
