For many years I had been interested in building a computer using the the Intel 8008 microprocessor.
Finally I had the time to revisit my wish. A search turned up Jim Loos' 8008 Single Board Computer.
Here was working hardware and most importantly, a monitor and a high level language! Jim had built
upon the work of Len Bayles's and Jim Kearney's 8008 computers. Credit for resurrecting SCELBAL BASIC
goes to Mike Willegal. Thank you Alfred Arnold for the AS Macro Assembler.

My first pass was a nearly exact copy of Jim's SBC with some modifications. Some parts were different 
based on what I had on hand. I chose to use Len Bayle's alternate clock design. Just something about 
tweeking pots while watching the pulse widths on a scope! I included several options to generate the 
-9v for the CPU.

I briefly considered wire wrapping the board, but decided that it would be less work if I taught
myself KiCad. The first board worked the first time I turned it on! I made a second version which is 
best forgotten.

The picture is version 3. I added an I/O bus and small I/O boards, along with some more circuit
modifications. Version 3.1 will be coming with a few minor tweeks, mostly in the silkscreen.
